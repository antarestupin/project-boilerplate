# Project Boilerplate

<!-- REMOVE FROM HERE -->

This is a boilerplate to use for projects. The goal is to quickly have a setup allowing you to work on your project without forgetting maintainability, with a structure that will scale with your team.

This boilerplate has been initially created for web app projects, but it also fits well with other kinds of projects.

## Features

Here's what this boilerplate provides to your project:

- A clean, scalable structure for your project
- A complete documentation with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org):
  - Pages commonly needed by developers (local environment setup, tools docâ€¦)
  - Domain documentation enhanced with [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/)'s sequence diagrams
  - Runbook for maintenance and events management
  - **[TODO]** Base setup for building a design system
- An advanced development environment:
  - External dependencies management with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and an optional [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) VM
  - Code generation with [Plop](https://plopjs.com/)
  - Code quality analysis with [Sonar](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
- **[TODO]** A base for testing:
  - e2e tests with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)
  - Performance tests with [Locust](https://locust.io/)

## Documentation

You can visit the documentation [here](https://antarestupin.github.io/project-boilerplate). There's not much to see as it's an empty documentation for your project, but it shows what you get out of the box.

If you want to know more about the structure of this boilerplate and the tools it provides, the following may help you:

- [Project structure](https://antarestupin.github.io/project-boilerplate/#/dev/structure)
- [Tools](https://antarestupin.github.io/project-boilerplate/#/dev/tools)

## How to use

First clone this repository:

```bash
git clone antarestupin/project-boilerplate myproject
cd myproject
```

Then install Node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And that's it. You can then run the docs server with `make run-docs` and follow the [instructions](http://localhost:3000/dev/local_setup) to install missing dependencies if needed.

You can also remove the section that describes this project in this README and uncomment the hidden section specific to your project (comments are there to help), and remove the `.git` directory.

## Todo

- Documentation
  - Design documentation
- Testing base
  - e2e tests
  - Performance tests w/ Locust
- DB filler / data faker
- Docker Compose configuration base
- Base infrastructure

  <!-- - Monitoring -->
  - UAA server (Keycloak, Jhipster UAA)
  <!-- - Configuration server (Spring Cloud Config) -->
- CI/CD pipeline w/ Jenkins
